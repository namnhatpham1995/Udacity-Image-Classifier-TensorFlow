# Final project for Deep Learning section in Udacity course "Introduction to Machine Learning with TensorFlow Nanodegree Program"



## Part 1: Developing an Image Classifier with Deep Learning using TensorFlow
In this first part of the project, you'll work through a Jupyter notebook to implement an image classifier with TensorFlow.

```bash
pip install foobar
```

## Usage

```python
import foobar

foobar.pluralize('word') # returns 'words'
foobar.pluralize('goose') # returns 'geese'
foobar.singularize('phenomena') # returns 'phenomenon'
```
